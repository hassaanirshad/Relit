# NEUTRINO: Fine-grained GPU Kernel Profiling via Programmable Probing

## Abstract
As GPUs play an increasingly important role in computer
systems in the scaling laws era, understanding fine-grained
GPU runtime behavior is more crucial than ever. However,
existing GPU kernel profilers, typically kernel-exclusive or
hardware-dependent, often fail to capture fine-grained mea-
surements. This paper presents NEUTRINO, a programmable
interface for GPU kernel profiling that leverages assembly-
layer probing to achieve instruction-level fine granularity, pro-
filing versatility across time and value domains, and hardware
independence. To better visualize the rich details captured
by NEUTRINO, we introduce the Densified Memory Access
Timeline (DMAT), a novel representation that offers new in-
sights into GPU runtime behavior. We implement NEUTRINO
in Linux for both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs and conduct
extensive evaluations and analyses. The results demonstrate
NEUTRINOâ€™s superior capabilities in GPU kernel profiling
with low overhead. We envision NEUTRINO as a valuable
tool for the community and have open-sourced it to facilitate
future research at https://github.com/open-neutrino/
