# Söze: One Network Telemetry Is All You Need for Per-flow Weighted Bandwidth Allocation at Scale

## Abstract
Weighted bandwidth allocation is a powerful abstraction
that has a wide range of use cases in modern data center net-
works. However, realizing highly agile and precise weighted
bandwidth allocation for large-scale cloud environments is
fundamentally challenging. In this paper, we propose Söze,
a lightweight decentralized weighted bandwidth allocation
system that leverages simple network telemetry features of
commodity Ethernet switches. Given the flow weights, Söze
can effectively use the telemetry information to compute and
enforce the weighted bandwidth allocations without per-flow,
topology, or routing knowledge. We demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of Söze through simulations and testbed experiments,
improving TPC-H jobs completion time by up to 0.59×and
0.79×on average.
